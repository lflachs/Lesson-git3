        This whole system of git and github seems extremly cumbersome unhandy. 
        Outside of the possibility to automate certain functions, at least I assume it is
        possible, there seems to be no good reason to use it. 
        Is it sheer tradition? It is not the lack of gui that annoys me, it is the byzantine structures 
        the system is based on. Is there really no more efficent way? 
        I am actually missing the days of my first PC, now MS-DOS seems to be user friendly.
        Well at least in hindsight. I am nostalgic for bloody fucking MS-Dos, and pascal what time to be alive....or may be I am getting old.
